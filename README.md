# dash-pyfolio

## Summary

Merging the defunct quantopian `pyfolio` and `empyrical` packages into a single package and using `plotly` as a plotting library

# Rationale

`plotly` offers a lot of nice functionalities, interacting with Dash, online reports, interactive graphs, ...
Merging the functionalities of `pyfolio` and `empyrical` makes sense to me as they are complement each other.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install dash-pyfolio
```
